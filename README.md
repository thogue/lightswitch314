# Lightswitch 314 v0.1 by Thogue

A simple web application to control remote power switches. Powered by a Raspberry Pi, Flask, and Bootstrap. The goal being a simple, sleek, affordable home automation. 

## Requirements

1. rPi
2. python + flask ( http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation )
3. bootstrap (included) ( http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ )
4. Cheap remote outlets. like: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064PKG3Q
5. 6x 1k ohm resistor, 3x 100k ohm resistor, 3x NPN Transistor, 3x PNP Transistor 

This uses the flask built-in webserver which is only for development. Please see : http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/

## Instructions

### Wire it all up....

To find the input on the remote use a multimeter to find backside of the buttons. (the side that measures 0v when the button is not pushed and should measure 5-12v with the button pushed)

See: imggurlink

Usage:

Edit lightswitch314.py, Look at the comment for GPIO mapping

To start the server simply run the lightswitch314.py, if you want to start this at boot I would recommend looking into the above statement about deploying this with a webserver. However, a simpler, not recommended method be to use screen. For example in rc.local "screen -d -m /usr/bin/python /path/to/lightswitch314.py"

To control input http://ip:5000 into your favorite browser (Designed with mobile devices in mind)

### Notes
v0.1 : First push, hardware still on a breadboard. I assume the wiring and choice of components could still use improvement. I used what I had at the time.

## Diagram w/ powering remote via rpi

Remove the battery from the remote.
